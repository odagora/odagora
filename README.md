## 👋 Hi there

I'm a Fullstack JavaScript Developer. In the past years, I've worked in personal projects using python, nodejs and Laravel. I also have experience of 5+ years in Digital Marketing and SEO.  

## 💡 What I'm doing now

- 🔭 I'm currently working in my personal website and portfolio
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Front-End and Back-End skills 
- 👯 I'm currently looking to contribute in open source projects
- 💬 You can ask me for help in OOP and MVC in PHP 
- 📫 Contact me at: oscar.d.gonzalez@gmail.com

## ✍ Languages and tools most used  
`Laravel` `PHP` `Javascript` `Python` `Nodejs` `Vuejs` `Bootstrap`

*NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages I have the most code on github*
